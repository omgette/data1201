### Question 1: What happens when you swap the delimiter from commas to tabs? How does the preview change? 
(Make sure "disable live preview is not checked if you don't see a change)
It changes the row delimiters where there are boxes that separate the tabs to commas separating the tabs instead. It makes the preview harder to read because everything is in one row instead of seperated nicely by boxes.

### Question 2: Try sorting the scientificName facet by name and by count. What problems are there with the data?
Some of the names are the same but are misspelled so their counts aren't added together and it looks like there's more unique names than there should be (for ex: Ammospermophilus harrisi has two with count 1 and one with count 58 instead of just one with count 60)

### Question 3: Use faceting to figure out the following:
#### How many different years are represented in this file?
16
#### What year occurs the most times?
1978(237 times)
#### What year occurs the least number of times?
1993(1 time)

### Question 4: What happens when you make a numerical facet of column note 1, then convert the column to numbers? Is something different about the facet compared to yr?
When you make a numerical facet it says there are no numerical values. Then when you convert the column to numbers, there is a lot of missing data(there are 515 blank in the graph)

### Question 5: Click and drag on the scatterplot facet you made to highlight a rectangle. What happens to the data points being displayed?
it changes the range of dates it's showing based on what is highlighted

### Question 6: After the last step, some columns are empty. (You can check by text faceting a column) Why? What do you think we can do to fix it?
some columns are empty because some of the scientific names have extra spaces and since there's only so many words some of the columns end up empty so in order to fix it we have to get rid of the extra space.
